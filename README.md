# Advanced-trajectory-tracking-mpc
This repository delves into the realm of applying Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a f1tenth car, a vital control technique that leverages optimization to forecast and mitigate system behavior over a finite horizon. The primary objective is to understand and implement MPC to direct a vehicle to adhere closely to a predefined trajectory.
